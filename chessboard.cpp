/*A chess board is an 8x8 grid. Given a knight at any position (x, y) and a number of moves k,
 * we want to figure out after k random moves by a knight,
 * the probability that the knight will still be on the chessboard. Once the knight leaves the board
 * it cannot move again and will be considered off the board.
